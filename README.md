# odin-recipes:
I've just built my own recipe collection on my computer. First, I created a homepage titled "Odin Recipes" (index.html). Then, I made my first recipe page for irish bundt cake, adding an image, description, ingredients, and steps while demonstrating my use if ordered/unordered lists. I repeated this process for two more recipes. Now, I have a cozy corner of the internet filled with delicious recipes, ready to inspire anyone who visits.
